Occasionally I get to speak at a conference or get interviewed about one of my
projects.

Mostly it has been regarding my work with
[Personal Telco](http://www.personaltelco.net/) and
[Weta Digital](http://www.wetadigital.com/). More recently there has been
interest in the work [Amy](https://www.amyherself.nz/) and I have been doing
with [Managers Anonymous](https://adam.nz/managers/).
