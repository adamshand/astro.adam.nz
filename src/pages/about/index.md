# Kia ora!

**I like making, collecting, and sharing things. This site is one of the ways I
do that. ~~It’s also where I talk about the
[freelancing services](https://adam.nz/hireme/) I offer.~~**

Personally and professionally I’m a bit of a mishmash. I’ve never had easy
answers to the questions of where I’m from or what I do. Much of my professional
experience is working with large-scale Linux and Open Source infrastructure.
However my favourite work is people focused. Helping others figure how how to
solve problems and get their career, business or family heading in the right
direction.

I am extremely curious and prone to poking at things until I can make sense of
them. As a result, my interests tend to be intense and short-lived. Despite
this, I have two abiding fascinations.

The first is the development (in myself and others) of the courage and skill to
navigate hard conversations. In this Vipassanā, Hatha yoga and Nonviolent
Communication have been some of my guides.

The second lacks a pithy description, but perhaps ecological literacy is close
enough. Permaculture was my first source of inspiration, followed later by
Holistic Management and
[Syntropic Agriculture](https://adam.nz/2019/syntropic-resources/). Learning to
see the living processes which make up our world, and to begin to understand how
we can work with them to regenerate our world, has been a revelation.

Since 2013 I’ve shared twelve acres on the Kāpiti Coast with my wife
[Tink](http://tink.nz/) and a constantly shifting array of wild and domestic
fuzzles. More recently we have been joined by my parents which is delightful.
