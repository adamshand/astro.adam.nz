I haven't written about my experience with Carnivore because I didn‚Äôt think I
had any interesting photos to show. I was slightly underweight when I began, and
my health improvements (while dramatic to me) have been mostly invisible.
However, the other day I was looking through old photos and was pleasantly
surprised!

When I was first starting out with Carnivore, I found detail laden testimonials
incredibly helpful and inspiring. In writing this, I've tried to find a balance
between brevity and detail. Hopefully you find it a useful resource for where
ever you are on your Carnivore adventure.

All feedback is welcome.

## A little history

I was (mostly) vegetarian for much of my adult life. In my late-20s, I developed
mild psoriasis and chronic constipation. In my early-30s, the psoriasis had
moved down into the nail beds of my fingers and toes (ouchy and really ugly). By
my mid-30s, I was having recurring joint injuries (mostly in my ankles). Since
they typically coincided with drinking, at the time I thought they were sprains.
In retrospect, I‚Äôm pretty sure it was gout. By my late-30s I'd been through a
divorce, 20 years of professional stress in the startup and VFX industries, and
had burnt out a couple of times.

At 39, disillusioned and exhausted, I
[ran away from everything](https://adam.nz/2010/life-after-weta/) and spent a
couple of years travelling. While travelling, I developed arthralgia (probably
psoriatic arthritis but undiagnosed) in my fingers and started getting five-day
headaches. Near the end of my travels, I spent time working on permaculture
farms and started to regularly eat meat again. By my mid-40s I‚Äôd figured out
that some foods were the cause of my symptoms (chilli, mandarins, honey, dried
fruit, and alcohol were the early discoveries).

By my late-40s, I was having a gout attack and a multi-day headache every 4-6
weeks. I was constantly exhausted and grumpy. After each gout attack, I had to
walk with a cane for a couple of weeks. The soles of my feet felt constantly
bruised and walking hurt. My knees constantly ached, and I had to use my hands
for support to sit down (or get up from) a chair. I couldn‚Äôt make a fist due to
swelling in my knuckles, and I‚Äôd lost most of the strength in my grip. To walk
down the stairs, I had to use the handrail. I was sleeping badly and was getting
up 2-3 times a night to pee. In some ways, the worst thing was that my brain
didn‚Äôt work that well anymore. I‚Äôd made my living being ‚Äúthe guy who could solve
problems,‚Äù and now everything was foggy and hard.

I vividly remember the moment when I realised that I was going to have to make
my peace with being sick. That I was probably going to be sick until I died, and
had to reset expectations for my life down to something ‚Äúrealistic.‚Äù Wrestling
with this realisation was what gave me the courage and motivation to try
something different.

I‚Äôll come back to this moment later.

## Slowly learning

At 30, I went to see a dermatologist about my psoriasis. He told me that there
was no cure for psoriasis and handed me a tube of steroid cream. The cream
worked, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was only treating a symptom. If
something had caused the psoriasis to appear, then it seemed reasonable to hope
that something might cure it? After a few months, when the cream ran out, I
didn‚Äôt renew the prescription. I would periodically spend an evening browsing
the internet attempting to find someone how had figured out how to cure
psoriasis.

At 35, while travelling, a friend told me about having terrible eczema on his
hands. He‚Äôd resolved it by eating only brown rice until his symptoms went away
(a couple of weeks). With the symptoms gone, he reintroduced foods one by one
until he found the culprit (eggs!). This was my introduction to the idea of an
elimination diet. When I got home, I enlisted my sister (who also has psoriasis)
and we tried a
[brown rice diet](https://adam.nz/2009/an-exclusion-diet-the-report/). After 10
days, I almost fainted on a walk. Rather than slowly and carefully reintroducing
foods, I promptly began to eat everything fat and sweet I could find. I learned
nothing, but my sister who managed a more sensible staged reintroduction
discovered that milky coffee and nut liquors were triggers.

At 41, I tried the
<a href="https://www.thepaleomom.com/start-here/the-autoimmune-protocol/">Paleo
Autoimmune Protocol</a> for a couple of months. My psoriasis mostly disappeared
in a week and my brain started working again. It was incredible, but slowly as
the work stress mounted I started to cheat. It started with occasional sugary
treats, then the coffee came back, and finally beer and pizza after work with
friends. Later I attempted to replicate the success, but never again managed to
get the same results with Paleo AIP.

At 44, I went overseas for a few weeks to work on a film set and then catchup
with old friends. I decided I was going to eat and drink whatever I wanted while
I was overseas. By the time I got home, I could barely function. I constantly
smelled awful and was light sensitive, I could barely think straight, and was
atypically moody. It took about six months to get back to something kind of
normal.

At 45, while researching psoriasis, I stumbled across a testimonial on
<a href="https://zerocarbzen.com/">Zero Carb Zen</a> about somebody who only ate
raw ground beef. The idea of eating raw ground beef both horrified and somehow
fascinated me. I couldn‚Äôt let it go and had to understand why someone would do
this. I spent the next six months reading and listening to everything I could
find about the Carnivore Diet.

At 46, with the encouragement of my wife‚Äôs herbalist, we decided to try
Carnivore. She made it about a week, I made it about a month. She quit out of
boredom after a week (but has stayed on a low-carb diet since, which has
drastically improved her energy, mood, and brain fog). I quit because I didn‚Äôt
notice any significant health improvements and my energy and mood was slowly
tanking. More on this later.

At 47, after six awful months of constant gout and headaches, I had the
realisation (mentioned above) that I was probably going to be sick forever. I
wanted to avoid taking the drugs the doctors had to offer, so I came back to
Carnivore out of desperation.

## Carnivore in earnest

For the first two months of Carnivore, I had back to back gout attacks and poor
energy. Fortunately, I was aware that
<a href="https://perfectketo.com/keto-and-gout/#5">transitioning into ketosis
can trigger gout</a>, but even so it was only grim determination that got me
through. I learned how to manage gout pain with tart cherry, then apple cider
vinegar, and finally (and best of all) with
<a href="http://www.icuredmygout.org/">baking soda</a>.

While researching gout, I stumbled across a comment in one of
<a href="https://twitter.com/ketocarnivore">Amber O‚ÄôHearn's</a> videos about a
correlation between high iron and gout. Investigating this led me to a forum
where people were discussing giving blood as a way to lower iron levels and thus
reduce attack pain and frequency. With nothing to lose, I booked in to give
blood and my gout attacks stopped. Sadly, I have no way of knowing if giving
blood was coincidental or causal.

With the gout behind me, it was time to figure out why my energy was still so
poor. With the help of
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ZeroCarbHealth/">Zero Carb Health</a>
and Zero Carb Zen, I decided that I wasn‚Äôt eating enough, and I especially
wasn‚Äôt eating enough fat. The problem was that I didn‚Äôt like eating fat, and if
I forced myself, I felt nauseous and got diarrhoea. After some experimenting, I
discovered that while chunks of pure fat (eg. steak fat) were an issue for me, I
could tolerate more fat if it was mixed in with meat. I started eating 70/30
fatty ground beef, sausages (made by our local butcher without any rusk or
preservatives) and fatty lamb chops. Within a few days of eating fattier meat,
my energy levels started to improve.

In retrospect, I think this is what I did wrong the first time I tried
Carnivore. I didn‚Äôt eat enough because I got bored with the food. I didn‚Äôt eat
enough fat (and since I was underweight, I also didn‚Äôt have fat stores to burn).
It also turned out that the ‚Äúpure pork‚Äù sausages I was eating a lot of contained
rusk, spices, and preservatives.

About six months into Carnivore, I had a moment where I suddenly realised that
‚ÄúI felt like me‚Äù again. I had energy again. The libido of a 30-year-old. My
nails were mostly clear. There was no blood when I blew my nose or brushed my
teeth. I didn‚Äôt need two pillows to sleep. My hands were strong again. I could
run up and down the stairs. My eyes weren‚Äôt crusty and scratchy in the morning.
I was no longer allergic to our cats and dogs. My digestion was regular. No more
dry skin or dandruff. Tinnitus was quieter. I slept through the night, even if I
had a glass of water before bed. The arthralgia in my hands, feet, and knees had
reduced from debilitating to annoying. I was going for walks with my wife,
riding my bike, and was enjoying being back out in the garden. My brain was
working, and once again it was fun to solve tricky problems.

## The ups and downs

At six months, one thing that hadn‚Äôt budged was my psoriasis. Again, thanks to
Zero Carb Zen and Zero Carb Health, I decided to try cutting out salt. After
about a week of no salt, I began getting regular cramps in my feet and calves.
It started happening overnight and slowly got worse. When I couldn‚Äôt make it
through a workday without cramping, I decided that going cold turkey had been a
bad idea. I added salt back into my diet until the cramps stopped. Then over a
few weeks I slowly reduced the amount of salt. What worked really well was
eating salt directly instead of salting my food. First thing in the morning and
immediately before bed, I‚Äôd put a little salt on my finger and eat it until it
stopped being sweet. This seemed to be enough salt to keep the cramps away. Over
the next few months, my psoriasis began to slowly heal.

There have been a few setbacks since I started Carnivore.

Twice I tried a small glass of low sugar soft drink. Once it was kombucha and
once ginger beer (both about 2% sugar). Both times I had a gout attack the
following day.

I‚Äôve had two multi-day headaches, both were from reducing caffeine consumption
too quickly. I sometimes get headaches as a flu symptom or if I let myself get
dehydrated. Long periods in air-conditioned spaces like planes seem especially
bad. I suspect that many of my past headaches have been from reducing caffeine
too quickly. I‚Äôve tried multi-month stretches without coffee and it never seemed
to make a difference.

I discovered that cheese, especially hard cheese, causes constipation. That
yogurt immediately cases my arthralgia to flare. Milk and cream seem fine
occasionally, but if I have them regularly I get joint pain and grouchy. Butter
and ghee seem fine in any quantity. I suspect it‚Äôs the proteins in dairy
(especially casein) that I‚Äôm intolerant of.

I‚Äôve tried various food introductions. They have almost all been unsuccessful.
Chilli, honey, and nuts and seeds (even in small amounts like spices) cause
immediate inflammation. Occasional, tiny amounts of fruit and vege seem to be
okay. But even tiny amounts, if eaten regularly, will cause my joint pain to
return.

I reintroduced salt a few times, and each time my psoriasis stopped healing and
slowly returned. I have managed to get my nails completely clear several times,
but never managed to completely get rid of my psoriasis.

About five years ago, I injured my knee while insulating our attic. Despite
visits to various professionals it has never fully healed, and I am unable to
kneel, sit cross-legged or squat. I was hoping that Carnivore would allow it to
heal, but so far, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. I am currently waiting for
an MRI in the hopes that that will allow them to determine the cause.

## Current status

On most days, I eat two meals (breakfast and dinner). Occasionally I'll have
three meals, and **very** occasionally I'll eat a huge breakfast and then not
eat anything until the following day.

For breakfast, I mostly eat 75/25 ground beef (with all the fat) or leftovers
with butter and three eggs (I seem to be fat hungry, and I am considering going
back to 70/30). In the evening, I most often eat sausages (my current favourite
is smoked beef and pork ‚Äî made by our local butcher without
[rusk](http://www.sausagemaking.co.uk/should-i-use-rusk-or-breadcrumbs-when-making-sausages/),
spices, or preservatives). Occasionally, we cook brisket, short ribs, lamb
roast, steak or salmon. My family eats a lot of roast chicken, but I will
typically just have a wing for variety and eat something else. If I need an
afternoon snack, I‚Äôll eat leftovers, smoked salmon, or tuna. I drink coffee
(mostly decaf) and occasionally have milk or cream with it as a treat.

I've managed to put on a few kg, but still struggle to gain weight.

My skin psoriasis is maybe 60% gone.

My nail beds are clear for months at a time, but when something spikes my
inflammation, the psoriasis comes back and then takes several months to go away.

Except for my injured knee, joint function and pain is mostly at minor annoyance
levels.

As long as I'm careful with caffeine, the headaches have stayed away. The one
exception has been when I got a headache with a cold. The big test will be the
next time I do a long haul flight.

Energy is mostly good, but I feel that there is still some improvement to come.

At this point, I‚Äôve been a Carnivore for nearly two years (21 months). I would
be content if I had to remain carnivorous for the rest of my life, but I would
love to be able to tolerate spices and sauces for additional flavour. This would
make travel and eating out **much** easier. In particular, being extremely
intolerant of chilli is astonishingly limiting. Perhaps this will come with
time.

_I‚Äôm currently trying a gut healing protocol with the support of my doctor._
